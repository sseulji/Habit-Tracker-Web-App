## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19.1.1 with Vite for fast development and building, installable as a PWA
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 4.1.14 with the tokens in [design.md](design.md)
- **Server**: Node.js + Express 5, SQLite via Node's built-in `node:sqlite`, web push via `web-push`
- **Planning**: `server/planner.js` fits habits into free calendar time, then moves, shrinks to the minimum version, or suggests a rest day when a meeting lands (see the PRD)
- **Calendar**: a demo calendar (or busy times you mark yourself); Google Calendar plugs into `server/calendar.js` once an OAuth client exists
- **Language**: JavaScript (ES6+)

## 🚀 Quick Start

Needs **Node.js 22.13 or newer** (for the built-in SQLite module).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheUnknown550/Habit-Tracker-Web-App.git
cd Habit-Tracker-Web-App
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` starts the API on port 8787 and the web app; open `http://localhost:5173/Habit-Tracker-Web-App/` and sign in with any demo name.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | API (restarts on change) + Vite dev server |
| `npm test` | Planner, time-zone and service tests |
| `npm run build && npm start` | Production: one server on port 8787 serving the API and the built app |

Data lives in `data/habits.db` (git-ignored). Push notification keys are generated on first start.

📖 **Detailed Installation Guide**: See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for comprehensive setup instructions, troubleshooting, and alternative installation methods.

## 🌐 Deployment

> **Note:** the calendar-aware version needs its Node server (sign-in, planning, push). GitHub Pages only hosts static files, so a Pages deploy of this branch shows the sign-in screen but can't reach the API. Deploy it to a Node host instead (`npm run build && npm start`, HTTPS required for push).

The original version was deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

**Live Demo**: [https://theunknown550.github.io/Habit-Tracker-Web-App/](https://theunknown550.github.io/Habit-Tracker-Web-App/)
